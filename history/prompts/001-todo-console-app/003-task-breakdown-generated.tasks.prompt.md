## Prompt

Title: Evolution of Todo – Phase I: Task Breakdown

Goal:
Generate a complete, ordered list of engineering tasks required to implement the Phase-I In-Memory Python Console Todo App based on the implementation plan and specification files.

System Role:
You are Claude Code acting as Technical Project Manager.
You must read:
- All spec files in /specs_history/phase_1/
- The implementation plan generated by sp.plan

You are NOT allowed to write any implementation code.
You must only output a task list.

Output Requirements:
Produce a markdown checklist with the following sections:

## Project Setup Tasks
## Core Data Model Tasks
## CLI Interface Tasks
## Feature Implementation Tasks
  - Add Task
  - Delete Task
  - Update Task
  - View Tasks
  - Mark Complete
## Validation & Error Handling Tasks
## Documentation Tasks
## Final Readiness Checklist

Each task must:
- Reference the spec file it comes from
- Be small enough to be implemented in a single commit
- Be ordered logically for incremental development

Constraints:
- Do NOT generate Python code.
- All tasks must be traceable to specs.
- No generic filler tasks — every task must be meaningful.

Success Condition:
The checklist must fully cover the scope of Phase-I so that sp.generate can be executed with zero ambiguity.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for Todo Console App Phase I:

**Output File**: `specs/001-todo-console-app/tasks.md`

**Task Summary**:
| Phase | Tasks | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Setup | T001-T009 (9) | Project structure, UV init, package creation |
| 2. Data Model | T010-T012 (3) | Task entity with dataclass |
| 3. Validation | T013-T020 (8) | Exceptions + validators |
| 4. CLI Interface | T021-T025 (5) | Menu and routing |
| 5. Features | T026-T049 (24) | All 5 operations |
| 6. Integration | T050-T053 (4) | Entry point wiring |
| 7. Documentation | T054-T056 (3) | Docs and validation |
| 8. Final Checklist | T057-T061 (5) | Success criteria |

**Total**: 61 tasks (12 parallelizable)

**User Story Mapping**:
- US1 (P1 - Core Workflow): 47 tasks
- US2 (P2 - Error Handling): 14 tasks

**Feature Implementation Order**:
Add → View → Delete → Update → Toggle

**All tasks**:
- Reference source spec files
- Include exact file paths
- Follow checkbox format with IDs
- Mapped to user stories

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete 61-task breakdown ready for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (task list generation)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement or direct task execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Organized by user-requested sections while maintaining spec traceability

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all 61 tasks follow checklist format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): standard tasks command with detailed section requirements
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
